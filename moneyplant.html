        <p class="write">The money tree plant (Pachira aquatica) is a foliage houseplant typically made up of 3 to 5 plants braided together to form one plant. The glossy green foliage at the top of the plant consists of palmately compound leaves, usually five narrow leaflets. The plant is said to bring good fortune and prosperity. </p>

        <h2>Plant Care</h2>
        <p>Grown like other tropical foliage plants, the money tree plant needs bright indirect light and high humidity. <br> It should be in a container with drainage holes and a loose, well-aerated potting mix. It does not need to be watered often; water when the top two inches are dry. It is best to increase the humidity as much as possible as houses are often dry inside, especially in the winter.  Either put the plant on a tray of pebbles and water or mist with water. Fertilize with a liquid houseplant fertilizer in the summer. As it grows, if you want to keep the braided appearance, you have to braid the new stems and hold in place with string until those stems become woody and the braid stays in place. The only pruning it will need is to remove old or diseased leaves.<p>
