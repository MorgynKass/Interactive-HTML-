          Money trees are one of the easiest houseplants you can grow - so
          they're perfect for new plant parents or people who have low levels of
          light in their homes. They're handsome plants, too, with a strong
          upright form, glossy leaves, and an attractive braided stem.

          Spider plants are one of the easiest houseplants to grow, even for
          beginners. It's also one of the most interesting. It likes medium to
          bright light throughout the year as well as average humidity and cool
          to average temperatures, although it can tolerate warmer conditions.
          It has long spider like leaves - hence the name.

      <h3>Why You Should Choose Real Plants Over Fake</h3>
      <p>
        Having real indoor plants rather than fake ones allows you to connect
        directly with nature and watching something grow under your care gives
        you a sense of satisfaction that fake plants just don't have.

        Fake plants are made from plastic, which isn't good for the environment.
        Growing real indoor plants cuts down on unnecessary plastic. Plus real
        plants also have some surprising superpowers, like the ability to
        increase humidity in your home or provide oxygen
