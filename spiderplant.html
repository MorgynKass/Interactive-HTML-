        <p class="write"> Spider plants are handsome in any décor. The long - grassy leaves typically are striped white and green or yellow. It takes its name from the baby plants, which resemble clusters of spiders dangling from long stems. <br> Native to Africa, the plant was first introduced to Europe at the end of the 18th century and was a mainstay in Victorian parlors. It's likely your grandma and mom had one, too. It is still very popular today.</p>

        <h2>Plant Care</h2>
        <p>During initial growth, water occasionally; once fully developed (within one year), water moderately. In the spring and summer months, keep the soil moist to encourage growth. Do not let the soil dry out too much and maintain average room temperature and humidity. Spider plants prefer temperatures between 55 and 80°F, which makes them a great indoor houseplant. Fertilize up to twice a month in the spring and summer, however, avoid overfertilization.</p>
